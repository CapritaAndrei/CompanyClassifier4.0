# 🚀 Complete Development Journey: Building an Insurance Company Classifier

**A 3-Month Journey from Prototype to Production**  
*The Evolution of Veridion1 → Veridion2 → Veridion3 → Veridion4*

---

## 📋 **The Original Challenge**

**Task**: Build a robust company classifier for a new insurance taxonomy

**Objectives**:
- Accept companies with descriptions, business tags, sector/category/niche
- Receive a static taxonomy (220+ insurance labels)
- Classify companies into one or more relevant insurance labels
- Present results and demonstrate effectiveness
- Scale to handle large datasets (thinking billions of records at Veridion)

**The Real Challenge**: No ground truth data. No existing mappings. No clear path from company descriptions to insurance labels.

---

# 🏗️ **Version 1: The Monolithic Prototype** 
*"Let's just get something working"*

## 🎯 **My Initial Approach**

Coming into this problem, I thought: *"How hard can this be? I'll just use semantic similarity between company descriptions and insurance labels."*

**My Strategy**:
- Single massive script (`main.py` - 500+ lines)
- Basic text preprocessing (lowercase, remove punctuation)
- Sentence transformers for embeddings
- Cosine similarity for matching
- Pick top 3 most similar labels with a basic treshold system

```python
# This was my "architecture" - everything in main()
def main():
    # Load data (hardcoded paths)
    companies_df = pd.read_csv('data/input/ml_insurance_challenge.csv')
    taxonomy_df = pd.read_excel('data/input/insurance_taxonomy.xlsx')
    
    # Preprocess inline
    companies_df['processed'] = companies_df['description'].apply(
        lambda x: x.lower().replace(',', '').replace('.', ''))
    
    # Load model inline
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Everything else inline...
    similarities = cosine_similarity(company_embeddings, taxonomy_embeddings)
    # Output top 3 labels per company
```

## 💭 **What I Was Thinking**

*"Semantic similarity should capture the meaning. If a company does 'plumbing services', it should match with 'Residential Plumbing Services' in the taxonomy. This seems straightforward."*

## 🚨 **Reality Check: The Problems**

### 1. **No Way to Validate Results**
- I was getting results, but had no idea if they were correct
- Similarity scores looked reasonable (0.3-0.7), but what did that mean?
- No ground truth to compare against

### 2. **Code Maintainability Nightmare**
- 500+ lines in one file
- Changing one thing broke everything else
- No modularity, no testing, no structure

### 3. **Performance Was Terrible**
- 10+ minutes per run because no caching
- Recomputing embeddings every time
- No batch processing optimization

### 4. **Results Looked Random**
- Companies were getting labels that didn't make sense
- "Software Development" companies getting "Construction Services"
- Threshold tuning didn't help much

## 🎓 **Key Realizations**

1. **"Working code is not enough"** - I needed code I could iterate on
2. **Semantic similarity alone isn't sufficient** - I needed business context
3. **Validation is critical** - Without ground truth, I was flying blind
4. **Architecture matters from day one** - Technical debt compounds fast

## 📊 **Version 1 Results**
- ✅ **It worked**: Basic classification was functional (kind of)
- ❌ **No validation**: Couldn't trust the results
- ❌ **Poor maintainability**: Couldn't iterate effectively
- ❌ **Questionable accuracy**: Results seemed random

---

# 🧠 **Version 2: The Few-Shot Learning Pivot**
*"I need ground truth data to validate anything"*

## 💡 **The Strategic Shift**

After Version 1's failure, I realized: **I can't validate what I can't measure.**

**My New Strategy**: 
- Create ground truth data through human-in-the-loop labeling
- Use few-shot learning approach
- Build interactive labeling system
- Focus on direct company → insurance label classification

## 🎯 **What I Built**

### Interactive Labeling System
```python
def interactive_labeling_session(self, label_name):
    """Smart candidate selection + human validation"""
    candidates = self.find_semantic_candidates(label_name, threshold=0.3)
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        print(f"Label: {label_name}")
        print(f"Company: {candidate['description']}")
        print(f"Similarity: {candidate['similarity']:.3f}")
        
        response = input("Match? (y/n/s/q): ")
        if response == 'y':
            self.training_data.append({
                'company': candidate,
                'label': label_name,
                'match': True
            })
```

### Smart Label Prioritization
Instead of trying all 220 labels, I prioritized the most common ones:
1. Residential Plumbing Services
2. Commercial Plumbing Services  
3. Residential Electrical Services
4. Commercial Electrical Services
5. Residential Roofing Services
... (focusing on the top 20 high-impact labels)

## 💭 **My Thought Process**

*"I need to be strategic. Instead of trying to solve everything at once, let me focus on the most common business types in my dataset. If I can get 20 labels working well with ground truth data, I can expand from there."*

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
```
Veridion2/
├── classifier.py      # Core classification logic
├── labeler.py         # Interactive labeling system
├── validator.py       # Validation framework  
├── config.py          # Configuration management
└── main.py           # Simple orchestration
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Company Representation**
```python
def create_company_representation(self, company):
    parts = []
    
    if company.get('description'):
        parts.append(f"Description: {company['description']}")
        
    if company.get('business_tags'):
        tags_text = self.parse_tags(company['business_tags'])
        parts.append(f"Business Tags: {tags_text}")
        
    for field in ['sector', 'category', 'niche']:
        if company.get(field):
            parts.append(f"{field.title()}: {company[field]}")
            
    return '. '.join(parts)
```

### 3. **Session Management**
- Save labeling progress in JSON files
- Resume sessions where I left off
- Track labeling statistics and quality

## 🎯 **Why This Approach Was Better**

1. **Ground Truth Creation**: Manual labeling gave me validation data
2. **Focused Scope**: 20 high-priority labels instead of overwhelming 220
3. **Quality Control**: Human judgment ensured accuracy
4. **Iterative**: Could improve the model as I added more labels

## 📊 **Version 2 Results**
- ✅ **Validation possible**: Had ground truth for 20 labels
- ✅ **Better architecture**: Modular, maintainable code
- ✅ **Quality focus**: High precision on covered labels
- ❌ **Limited coverage**: Only 20 labels covered
- ❌ **Manual bottleneck**: Labeling was time-intensive (and not scalable)

## 🤔 **The Limitation I Hit**

*"This approach works great for 20 labels, but scaling to 220 labels would take months of manual labeling. I need something that can handle the full taxonomy more efficiently. And most crucial, I want to build this to scale so I had to start over."* 

---

# 🎨 **Version 3: The NAICS Bridge Experiment (this was a good one)**
*"What if I could use existing taxonomies to bootstrap training data?"*

## 💡 **The Strategic Insight**

Looking at the problem differently, I thought: *"NAICS codes already classify businesses. If I could map insurance labels to NAICS codes, I could use massive existing NAICS datasets for training. Bigger and cleaner data means better ML pipeline, or at least that's what I was thinking at the time, we will get to see soon why I was half wrong and half right."*

**My Strategy**:
- Map insurance labels to NAICS codes using semantic similarity
- Use existing NAICS-labeled datasets (like the Census Bureau's BEACON)
- Generate training data automatically: Company → NAICS → Insurance Label

## 🔧 **What I Built**

### NAICS Bridge System
```python
def create_naics_insurance_mapping(self):
    """Map insurance labels to NAICS codes via semantic similarity"""
    
    # Get embeddings for both taxonomies
    insurance_embeddings = self.model.encode(self.insurance_labels)
    naics_embeddings = self.model.encode(self.naics_descriptions)
    
    # Calculate similarities
    similarities = cosine_similarity(insurance_embeddings, naics_embeddings)
    
    # Create mappings with interactive approval
    mappings = {}
    for i, insurance_label in enumerate(self.insurance_labels):
        best_matches = np.argsort(similarities[i])[-5:][::-1]
        
        for naics_idx in best_matches:
            naics_code = self.naics_codes[naics_idx]
            similarity = similarities[i][naics_idx]
            
            if self.approve_mapping(insurance_label, naics_code, similarity):
                mappings[naics_code] = insurance_label
                break
    
    return mappings
```

### Training Data Generation
```python
def generate_training_data(self):
    """Use BEACON dataset + NAICS mappings = massive training data"""
    
    # Load BEACON training data (40k+ examples)
    X, y, sample_weight = load_naics_data(vintage="2017")
    
    # Apply mappings to generate insurance labels
    training_data = []
    for description, naics_code in zip(X, y):
        if naics_code in self.naics_insurance_mapping:
            insurance_label = self.naics_insurance_mapping[naics_code]
            training_data.append({
                'description': description,
                'insurance_label': insurance_label,
                'naics_code': naics_code
            })
    
    return training_data  # 11,646 examples across 47 labels!
```

## 💭 **My Reasoning**

*"This is brilliant! Instead of manually labeling thousands of examples, I can leverage the Census Bureau's BEACON dataset. They've already labeled 40k+ (only in 2017 and every other 5 years a new dataset comes, so I could use an even bigger dataset possibly) company descriptions with NAICS codes. If I can map insurance labels to NAICS codes, I instantly get massive training data."*

## 🎯 **The Breakthrough Discovery**

### BEACON Model Integration
I discovered the Census Bureau's BEACON (Business Establishment Automated Classification of NAICS) system:
- Already trained on 41,918 company descriptions
- Proven methodology from U.S. Census Bureau
- Could predict NAICS codes from business descriptions

### Master Map Strategy
```python
# Interactive approval process for mapping quality
def approve_mapping(self, insurance_label, naics_code, similarity):
    print(f"Insurance Label: {insurance_label}")
    print(f"NAICS Code: {naics_code}")
    print(f"NAICS Description: {self.naics_descriptions[naics_code]}")
    print(f"Similarity: {similarity:.3f}")
    
    response = input("Approve this mapping? (y/n): ")
    return response.lower() == 'y'
```

## 📊 **Version 3 Results**

### The Success
- ✅ **Massive training data**: 11,646 labeled examples across 47 insurance labels
- ✅ **Quality control**: All 421 NAICS mappings manually validated
- ✅ **Leveraged existing solution**: Didn't reinvent NAICS classification
- ✅ **Scalable approach**: Fully automated pipeline after initial mapping

### The Challenge
- ⚠️ **Coverage limitation**: Only 47 of 220 insurance labels had NAICS mappings
- ⚠️ **One-time setup**: Creating the Master Map required significant manual work
- ⚠️ **(and what I didn't see at that time, Description similarity between datasets**: Why even when I succeeded, I actually failed. (we will talk about this a bit later)

## 🎓 **Key Insight: Problem Reframing**

**Original Question**: "How do I map insurance labels to NAICS codes?"  
**Better Question**: "How do I use NAICS prediction to generate insurance training data?"

This reframing was the breakthrough. Instead of trying to map insurance labels to NAICS codes, I used BEACON to predict NAICS from descriptions, then mapped those to insurance labels.

## 💭 **Why This Was a Game Changer**

*"I realized I was asking the wrong question. I didn't need to map insurance labels to NAICS codes - I needed to use NAICS prediction as a way to generate training data. The BEACON model already solved the hard part (description → NAICS). I just needed to solve NAICS → Insurance mapping."*


*"Now I owe an explanation. Why did I not send this solution? Great question. I had a banger validation system, based on real-world VERIFIED data, so that was not the problem. Looking at it from a top down perspective is hard to see where this solution fails. The real problem is noise, or better said, inaccuracy. This model is perfect for what is designed to do. Takes business descriptions (the keyword here being business) and gives a NAICS code in return. The problem is that our dataset is filled mostly (around 60%, information which I found out way later) with marketing descriptions, descriptions that are scraped from the web, and not designed to be fed in a business prediction system. So the system I built, even with all its problems, the difficulty of the master map, etc. is even now a working version, it just solves a different, already solved problem. At the time I just saw some concerning data that made me think twice before sending, and I thought what the hell, and started rebuilding from the ground up. Every time I have done that I got new insight, and even if I didn't see it then, I knew something was up, which I eventually figured it out, So 4th version here I come."*

# 🚀 **Version 4: The Production Solution** 
*"Let's build something that actually works at scale"*

## 💡 **The Final Strategy**

By Version 4, I had learned the key lessons:
1. **Leverage what works**: BEACON for NAICS prediction was proven
2. **Two-tier approach**: Different strategies for different company types
3. **Quality over coverage**: Better to have fewer high-quality labels
4. **Automate everything**: Manual processes don't scale

## 🏗️ **The Two-Tier Architecture**

### Tier 1: Original Business Tags (60% coverage)
```python
def classify_with_business_tags(self, company):
    """Direct semantic similarity: business tags → insurance labels"""
    
    if not company.get('business_tags'):
        return None
    
    # Parse and combine business tags
    tags_text = self.parse_business_tags(company['business_tags'])
    
    # Get embeddings and find most similar insurance labels
    tag_embedding = self.model.encode([tags_text])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(tag_embedding, self.taxonomy_embeddings)[0]
    
    # Apply threshold and keyword boost
    selected_labels = self.select_labels_with_threshold(similarities, threshold=0.47)
    
    return selected_labels
```

### Tier 2: Synthetic Business Tags (39% additional coverage)
```python
def classify_with_synthetic_tags(self, company):
    """Extract semantic keywords from descriptions for unlabeled companies"""
    
    if not company.get('description'):
        return None
    
    # Extract business keywords from description using semantic similarity
    description_embedding = self.model.encode([company['description']])
    
    # Find most similar business tags from existing corpus
    tag_similarities = cosine_similarity(description_embedding, self.business_tag_embeddings)[0]
    
    # Use high-similarity tags as synthetic business tags
    synthetic_tags = self.extract_synthetic_tags(tag_similarities, threshold=0.7)
    
    if synthetic_tags:
        # Now classify using these synthetic tags
        return self.classify_with_business_tags({'business_tags': synthetic_tags})
    
    return None
```

### Quality Control: Heatmap Verification
```python
def heatmap_cleaning(self, classified_data):
    """Remove noisy assignments using frequency and sector analysis"""
    
    # Frequency filtering: remove labels with ≤5 occurrences
    label_counts = classified_data['assigned_labels'].value_counts()
    rare_labels = label_counts[label_counts <= 5].index
    
    # Sector misplacement detection (85% dominance rule)
    for label in self.all_labels:
        label_companies = classified_data[classified_data['assigned_labels'].str.contains(label)]
        sector_distribution = label_companies['sector'].value_counts(normalize=True)
        
        if sector_distribution.iloc[0] > 0.85:  # One sector dominates
            dominant_sector = sector_distribution.index[0]
            # Remove this label from companies in other sectors
            misplaced_mask = (classified_data['assigned_labels'].str.contains(label)) & \
                           (classified_data['sector'] != dominant_sector)
            classified_data.loc[misplaced_mask, 'assigned_labels'] = \
                classified_data.loc[misplaced_mask, 'assigned_labels'].str.replace(label, '')
    
    return classified_data
```

## 🎯 **The Automated Pipeline**

### Single Command Orchestration
```python
class PipelineOrchestrator:
    def run_pipeline(self):
        print("🚀 VERIDION4 AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE")
        
        # Stage 1: Load data
        self.load_data()
        
        # Stage 2: Tier 1 Classification (Original Business Tags)
        if self.run_tier1_classification():
            print("✅ Tier 1 complete: 60% coverage achieved")
        
        # Stage 3: Tier 2 Classification (Synthetic Business Tags)
        if self.run_tier2_classification():
            print("✅ Tier 2 complete: 99% coverage achieved")
        
        # Stage 4: Heatmap Verification
        if self.run_heatmap_verification():
            print("✅ Heatmap cleaning complete: 97% final coverage")
        
        # Stage 5: Analytics and reporting
        self.generate_analytics()
        
        print("🎉 PIPELINE COMPLETE!")
```

## 💭 **My Final Thought Process**

*"After three versions, I finally understood the problem. It's not about finding the perfect algorithm - it's about combining multiple strategies intelligently. Some companies have good business tags (use Tier 1). Others don't, but have good descriptions (use Tier 2). Some assignments will be noisy (use heatmap cleaning). The key is orchestrating these approaches into a single, automated pipeline."*

*"Now that could be the ending, but it lacks personal touch. How did I get to this, and why is this the best way for this solution. And why if you got this solution, why not train an ML model based on this data. To be real with you, the dataset is just filled with gaps and problems you need to solve. You did this to test us, I get it, the real world datasets will be noisy, and the solutions we come up with will not always reflect the most optimal algorithms we learn in school, the real world just isn't so clean, and precise. My conclusion from the last solution was something along the lines of "I need to build a system that even if it's not perfect, can scale without me, and can self clean the noisy data", so I went and started building. I used past knowledge, decided that business tags are just filled with value, so I ignored anything else. I tried this time to not get stuck in complex math, I thought if I can build a great system with less information the better. I can always go back and use the other data that is given but I can't get more information that I have already. I built the first part of the code, that gives multiple labels based on a simple embedding similarity between the lexical field of all the business tags. sort of combined them and got similarities with labels, and I got lucky, the dataset has very little to almost 0 bad business tags (that means almost 0 noise). Lucky, but this solution didn't work for all companies, obviously. In the first iteration I have some ancient scripts that I used to analyze the dataset, and I remembered, there are some missing tags, some companies have none, some have absent descriptions, etc. and I thought, ok, my similarity, with a median threshold labeled 60% of the dataset, it means the rest of the dataset has not that great business tags. And I went back to the drawing board. And not even kidding, it hit me when I was sleeping one night, that I can search in the descriptions for tags. This was not new, I tried something similar in one of my past solutions, but the problem I faced back then, was that I was inventing tags, copy paste from descriptions, but now I did it differently. After the algorithm decided that it might have found a tag (better said keyword or keyword phrase), I make a similarity embedding search in all the 50k individual business tags (I have also built a caching system for all the embeddings they need to be calculated only one time, after that, the search is instant), and this way instead of having 100k+ tags or even millions, I get SYNTHETIC business tags that are the same as the ones given by the dataset. That means when / if I decide to build an ML model on this data, it will be way way less noisy, and we can train on it (maybe). Since I was not sure of this method (I found out later it has on average 80% confidence, which is almost double my 2nd best solution, the one used in phase 1), I made it to only pick one synthetic label instead of many, and pick only one label, so that we satisfy the challenge requirement (at least one tag per firm). Both phases combined give me 99% coverage. I did tinker with this phase a bit, I tried to use this algorithm in general, but this is where I figured out that descriptions that are left, are left because the tags were no good. in reality the phase 1 clears a lot of the bad descriptions, the marketing descriptions I talked about a bit in phase 3 conclusions tab, and what is left are companies with good descriptions for this type of algorithm, that's why the 2 phase approach works so good, it complements each other. Also a good thing to mention is that I can mess with the settings, and I did, and if the first phase only labels 55% the phase 2 covers the rest for again 99% coverage, which is awesome. I think this is a feature engineered by your testing team, making sure there are both types of descriptions, but also making sure every company either has good business tags or good descriptions, and in a real world example I feel like the coverage could drop a bit, or the results would be a bit worse. Anyway, now that I felt decent about the solution, I had to ask myself, where in the hell do I get a validation system? No ground truth, no nothing just me and my smart system that makes very good educated guesses (more like matching mahjong pieces but whatever, the problem stands). I can't even remember how I thought of this but this idea of a counter popped in my head. I did a bit of reading online and figured out that the concept that I was thinking about was called a heatmap. In simple terms, we take a label and check which types of companies have that exact labels. It's simpler to visualize with an example, let's say we take the label "Event Planner". Now even if we are not sure in which sector this label should be (again, no ground truth), we can do something smart. we can count how many times was used for every sector, category or niche. It's a longer story why I didn't rely on the category and niche part of this, but long story short is the dataset is too small, and with little data there can be mistakes when you work with frequency algorithms. So we are left to work on the sector level, so we count how many times this label has been used across all sectors. We see that in Services is used 96% of the time and 3% is used in Manufacturing and 1% in Government. The Heatmap just clears the label from the other 2 sectors (all sectors outside the one sector that has 90% or more) This automatically cleans the answer, but also gives a validation potential. We can take the final dataset and initial dataset (labeled) and see difference in coverage, which labels got cleared from where, and other useful data. and let's say if we go from 99% coverage to 97%, we can also look at how many correct labels are now versus previous version to see accuracy. I am aware this is not the best validation system, but I wanted to build something different than similarity scores between sectors - category - niche and the label assigned, I wanted to add my own twist to the problem, and this is how I thought to do it. I guess this is it, this is the task solved, scalable solution for any and all similar datasets, with a relatively solid way for the system to automatically validate itself, and also clear itself. There are definitely some problems with the fact that the dataset is skewed in the direction of Services and Manufacturing, but with a large enough dataset this skew should be less and less of a problem and more and more an advantage. This system can and is meant to scale to way larger datasets, I don't think honestly is meant for 150M datasets, but It can break 10M. The scaling issue is not solved but it can be, there is room for improvement."*
