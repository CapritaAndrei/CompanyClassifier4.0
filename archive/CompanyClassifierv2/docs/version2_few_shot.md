# Version 2: Few-Shot Learning Approach

## Overview

Version 2 represents a fundamental shift in approach: **direct company-to-insurance-label classification** using few-shot learning with human-in-the-loop labeling. This approach eliminates the intermediate SIC code step and focuses on the core problem.

## Key Innovation: Direct Classification

Instead of the complex indirect approach:
```
Company → SIC Code → Insurance Label ❌
```

We use direct classification:
```
Company → Insurance Label ✅
```

## What We Built

### 1. Interactive Labeling System

**Core Components:**
- **Smart Candidate Selection**: Uses semantic similarity to find relevant companies for each label
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple y/n/s/q commands for quick labeling
- **Session Management**: Saves labeling progress and session data
- **Label Prioritization**: Focuses on high-impact labels first

**Example Session:**
```
📋 LABEL 1/20: Residential Plumbing Services
--------------------------------------------------

🔍 Finding candidates for: 'Residential Plumbing Services'
   Found 15 candidates (similarity >= 0.3)

📊 Candidate 1 (similarity: 0.445)
Description: EnCompass Pipeline is a company that specializes in pipeline construction...
Tags: ['Erosion and Sediment Control Services Provider', 'Pipe Coating Services'...]
Category: Construction Services

Does this match 'Residential Plumbing Services'? (y/n/s/q/?): y
✅ Labeled as MATCH
```

### 2. Smart Label Prioritization

**Priority Algorithm:**
1. **Service Type Scoring**: Prioritizes labels with common service types (plumbing, electrical, construction)
2. **Clarity Scoring**: Prefers shorter, clearer labels (≤4 words)
3. **Market Relevance**: Boosts residential/commercial services (common in dataset)

**Top 20 Priority Labels:**
1. Residential Plumbing Services
2. Commercial Plumbing Services  
3. Residential Electrical Services
4. Commercial Electrical Services
5. Residential Roofing Services
6. Commercial Construction Services
7. Landscaping Services
8. Field Welding Services
9. Fencing Construction Services
10. Sidewalk Construction Services
... and 10 more

### 3. Semantic Candidate Finding

**Process:**
1. **Label Embedding**: Create semantic embedding for target label
2. **Company Embedding**: Create embeddings for company descriptions
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Use cosine similarity to find matches
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Only show candidates above similarity threshold (0.3)

**Example Candidate Selection:**
```
Label: "Residential Plumbing Services"
Company: "ABC Plumbing & Heating - Residential and commercial plumbing services"
Similarity: 0.789 ✅ (High confidence match)

Label: "Commercial Construction Services"  
Company: "XYZ Construction - Heavy infrastructure and utility construction"
Similarity: 0.445 ✅ (Moderate confidence match)

Label: "Software Development Services"
Company: "TechCorp - Web development and mobile app solutions"  
Similarity: 0.234 ❌ (Below threshold)
```

### 4. Comprehensive Company Representation

**Text Combination Strategy:**
```python
def create_company_representation(self, company):
    parts = []
    
    # Description
    if company.get('description'):
        parts.append(f"Description: {company['description']}")
        
    # Business tags (parsed from various formats)
    if company.get('business_tags'):
        tags_text = parse_tags(company['business_tags'])
        parts.append(f"Business Tags: {tags_text}")
        
    # Additional fields
    for field in ['sector', 'category', 'niche']:
        if company.get(field) and pd.notna(company[field]):
            parts.append(f"{field.title()}: {company[field]}")
            
    return '. '.join(parts)
```

**Example Output:**
```
"Description: Welchcivils is a civil engineering and construction company that specializes in designing and building utility network connections. Business Tags: Construction Services Multi-utilities Utility Network Connections Design and Construction. Category: Civil Engineering Services. Niche: Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction"
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

**Efficient CSV Handling:**
```python
def load_companies(self, sample_size=None):
    companies = []
    with open('data/input/ml_insurance_challenge.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for i, company in enumerate(reader):
            if sample_size and i >= sample_size:
                break
            companies.append(company)
    return companies
```

**Taxonomy Analysis:**
```python
def analyze_label_patterns(self):
    # Extract service types, modifiers, activities
    service_types = set()
    modifiers = set() 
    activities = set()
    
    for label in self.labels:
        words = label.lower().split()
        # Analyze patterns for prioritization
```

### 2. Semantic Search Engine

**Embedding Creation:**
```python
# Label embeddings (created once)
self.label_embeddings = self.model.encode(self.labels)

# Company embeddings (created on-demand)
company_texts = [self.create_company_representation(c) for c in sample_companies]
company_embeddings = self.model.encode(company_texts)
```

**Similarity Calculation:**
```python
def find_labeling_candidates(self, label_name, n_candidates=10, min_similarity=0.3):
    label_idx = self.labels.index(label_name)
    label_embedding = self.label_embeddings[label_idx].reshape(1, -1)
    
    similarities = cosine_similarity(label_embedding, company_embeddings)[0]
    
    # Filter and rank candidates
    candidate_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1]
    good_candidates = []
    
    for idx in candidate_indices:
        if len(good_candidates) >= n_candidates:
            break
        if similarities[idx] >= min_similarity:
            good_candidates.append({
                'company': sample_companies[idx],
                'similarity': similarities[idx],
                'text': company_texts[idx]
            })
```

### 3. Session Management

**Data Structure:**
```python
session_data = [{
    'company_id': company.get('id', f"unknown_{total_labeled}"),
    'company_text': self.create_company_representation(company),
    'label': label,
    'match': True,  # or False
    'similarity': similarity,
    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
}]
```

**File Organization:**
```
data/labeled/
├── session_20241201_143022.json  # Individual session
├── session_20241201_150145.json  # Another session
└── all_labels.json               # Master file with all labels
```

## Why This Approach Works

## Comparison with Version 1

| Aspect | Version 1 (SIC) | Version 2 (Few-Shot) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Approach** | Indirect (Company → SIC → Label) | Direct (Company → Label) |
| **Validation** | No ground truth | Manual labeling provides validation |
| **Complexity** | High (4-step hierarchy) | Low (single step) |
| **Performance** | 0.4-0.6 confidence | 0.4-0.8 similarity for candidates |
| **Maintainability** | Complex codebase | Simple, focused code |
| **Scalability** | Limited by SIC taxonomy | Unlimited by adding more labels |

## Next Steps for Version 2

### 1. Complete the Training Pipeline
```python
def train_few_shot_classifier(self):
    # Prepare training data from labeled examples
    # Train logistic regression for multi-label classification
    # Save model for prediction
```

### 2. Add Evaluation Framework
```python
def evaluate_on_test_set(self, test_companies):
    # Test classifier on held-out examples
    # Calculate precision, recall, F1-score
    # Generate classification report
```

### 3. Implement Active Learning
```python
def find_uncertain_examples(self):
    # Identify companies with low confidence predictions
    # Prioritize these for manual labeling
    # Improve model iteratively
```

### 4. Scale to Full Dataset
- Train on 200-300 labeled examples
- Apply to all 9,500 companies
- Generate confidence scores for each prediction
- Flag low-confidence predictions for manual review

## Key Success Factors

- Focused codebase that's easy to understand and maintain
- Clear data flow from input to output

## Conclusion

Version 2 represents a successful pivot from a complex, indirect approach to a simple, direct solution. By focusing on the core problem (company → insurance label classification) and incorporating human expertise through manual labeling, we've created a system that:

- ✅ **Works**: Can classify companies into insurance labels
- ✅ **Validates**: Manual labeling provides ground truth
- ✅ **Scales**: Can grow from 20 to 220 labels
- ✅ **Maintains**: Simple codebase that's easy to understand and modify

This approach demonstrates the value of **starting simple** and **focusing on the core problem** rather than over-engineering solutions with unnecessary complexity.
