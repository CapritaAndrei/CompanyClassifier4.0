# Veridion3 Project Cleanup Report
Generated: 20250627_162646

## 🎯 Cleanup Summary

### ✅ Actions Completed
- Created new modular directory structure
- Moved core files to src/ package structure
- Identified and kept best performing model (Logistic Regression - 70.5% accuracy)
- Archived 102 development files
- Consolidated requirements into single file
- Organized documentation
- Removed backup files and cache
- Created production entry script

### 🏆 Production Model
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: 70.5%
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: 78.3%
- **Top-5 Accuracy**: 78.7%
- **F1-Score**: 70.3%

### 📦 Archived Items
- Experimental implementations
