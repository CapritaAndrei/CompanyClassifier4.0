## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Read the Journey**: Start with `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md` to understand how we arrived at the final solution
2. **Understand the Solution**: Read `FINAL_SOLUTION.md` for technical implementation details
3. **Explore Previous Versions**: Check `archive/version3/` for historical approaches

## 📖 Key Documents

### [DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md](./DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md)
The complete story of the project evolution:
- **Version 1**: Direct API mapping (Failed)
- **Version 2**: Hierarchical NAICS mapping (Partial success)
- **Version 3**: Embedding-based semantic mapping (Major progress)
- **Version 4**: BEACON-based solution (SUCCESS)

### [FINAL_SOLUTION.md](./FINAL_SOLUTION.md)
Technical implementation of the working solution:
- BEACON model architecture
- Master Map structure
- Training data generation
- Production pipeline

## 🔍 Key Insights

### The Problem Reframing
- **Initial Question**: "How do we map insurance labels to NAICS?"
- **Final Answer**: "How do we use NAICS prediction to generate insurance training data?"

### The Breakthrough
Instead of trying to map insurance labels to NAICS codes, we:
1. Use BEACON to predict NAICS from company descriptions
2. Map predicted NAICS codes to insurance labels via Master Map
3. Generate massive training dataset automatically

### Results
- ✅ **11,646 training examples** immediately available
- ✅ **47 insurance labels** covered
- ✅ **248 examples per label** on average
- ✅ **Fully automated pipeline**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Apply to 9k Dataset**: Process all companies through BEACON pipeline
2. **Expand Master Map**: Add more NAICS codes for better coverage
3. **Train Final Classifier**: Use generated training data for production

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BEACON Training Examples | 41,918 |
| Master Map Coverage | 421 NAICS codes |
| Mappable Training Examples | 11,646 |
| Insurance Labels Covered | 47 |
| Average Examples per Label | 248 |
| Coverage Percentage | 27.8% |

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

1. **Leverage Existing Solutions**: BEACON already solved the hard part
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have 47 high-quality labels than 220 uncertain ones
3. **Iterative Development**: Each version built on previous lessons
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Automated pipelines essential for production
5. **Problem Reframing**: Sometimes the solution is to change the question
